# Tardigrade Architecture

*(Read [readme](README.md) first for a high-level intro.)*

## Workflow modules

Sandboxing workflows as WASM modules brings multiple benefits:

- A workflow can be compiled once and run everywhere. The workflow artifact is well-defined
  and holistic.
- A workflow can be suspended at wait points, its state persisted and then restored
  completely transparently for workflow logic.
- The runtime can (theoretically) customize aspects of workflow execution, e.g., priorities
  of different tasks. It can create and escalate incidents on task failure (perhaps, continuing
  executing other tasks if possible), control rollback of the workflow state etc.
- A workflow could (theoretically) implemented in any WASM-targeting programming language
  and can run / be debugged in any WASM-supporting env (e.g., in a browser).
- Sandboxing means that interfaces for interacting with the external world are well-defined
  (e.g., in terms of security) and can be emulated (e.g., for testing) with reasonable effort.

Further, using Rust is beneficial since it has pull-based / cancellable futures
(vs push-based futures in JS, Java etc.). Task cancellation in particular
is a frequently-used feature in process orchestration (cf. interrupting subprocesses
and boundary events in [BPMN]).

Workflow definition is a WASM module that has well-defined imports / exports.
On the high level, imports define the following functionality:

- Acquiring data inputs and channels
- Implementation of [`Stream`] / [`Sink`] interfaces for inbound / outbound channels,
  respectively
- Runtime interface (spawning tasks, creating timers, polling timers, 
  polling tasks for completion)

Exports provide the following functionality:

- Creating the main task
- Polling and dropping tasks
- Creating and waking [`Waker`]s
- Low-level plumbing (e.g., allocating bytes)

Tasks (including the main task) are `Box<dyn Future<Output = ()>>`. Tasks and wakers
are put in a [`Slab`]-like data struct on the client
and are represented on the host side by unique numeric IDs.
This is motivated  by the fact that ID uniqueness is required in some cases,
so using pointers instead of IDs would be unsound.
Dropping tasks and wakers is controlled by the host.

ABI for host â†” client conversions is (so far) implemented manually. Potentially,
[Canonical ABI] / [`wit-bindgen`] could be used instead, but this seems unwarranted
for now. (Additionally, the async part of `wit-bindgen` is unusable since
it ascribes to a push-based futures model, and workflows need a pull-based / cancellable one.)

In addition to imports / exports, a workflow module also defines a workflow interface
(e.g., names, description and specs for inputs and channels). It is serialized
as JSON in a custom WASM section, similar to how it is done in `wasm-bindgen`.

## Typed workflows

To interact with workflows, Tardigrade uses a concept of a *handle*. A workflow
handle is composed of the handles of its elements (channels, data inputs, etc.),
usually using the proc macros from the corresponding crate. Handle type is parameterized
by the *environment*; besides WASM client env, there are environments
for workflow testing and for interacting with a workflow executing in a runtime
(low-level sync and async versions).

Handles allow interacting with a workflow in a type-safe way, but the API
is also flexible enough to allow workflows with the interface not known at compilation time.

## Repository organization

### Crates

- The `tardigrade` crate [at the root](.) provides client bindings
  (i.e., it is necessary to include it as a dependency for workflow WASM modules).
- The [`tardigrade-derive`](crates/derive) crate provides proc macros
  for client bindings.
- The [`tardigrade-shared`](crates/shared) crate provides some types
  that are used by multiple crates, in particular, the macro crate.
- The [`tardigrade-rt`](crates/rt) crate provides a runtime for workflow modules.

### Other stuff

- [Sample workflow](e2e-tests/basic) tests all other crates end-to-end.
